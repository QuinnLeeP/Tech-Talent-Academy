        <h4>In Popular Culture</h4>
        <p>Penguins are widely considered to be fairly endearing for their upright, waddling gait, swimmiing ability and lack of fear of humans with their blank-and-white plumage to be likened to a suit and tie. 
        </p>
        <p>Penguins have been the subject of many books, films and TV shows over the years such as Happy Feet, Surf's Up and Madagascar. 
        There has also been a feature length documentary called <strong>March of the Penguins</strong> and several BBC documentaries including BBC Earth.
