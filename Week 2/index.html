        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live mostly in the southern hemisphere: where only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Penguins are highly adapted for life in the water and have dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea.  </p>

        <h4>Living Species</h3>
            With penguins, there are Genus types and species types. These Genus types are:
            <ol>
                <li>Aptenodytes</li>
                <li>Pygoscelis</li>
                <li>Eudyptula</li>
                <li>Spheniscus</li>
                <li>Megadyptes</li>
                <li>Eudyptes</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each Genus type has several species type realted to it with the overall family being named <em>Subfamily Spheniscinae</em></p>

        <h4>Distribution and Habitat</h4>
        <p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone.
        </p>
        <p>Several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of Bergmann's Rule, where larger-bodied populations live at higher latitudes than smaller-bodied populations. There is some disagreement about this and several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.
        </p>
        <p>Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa.Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of 2 million in France's remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.

    <div id="Pop_Culture">
        <h4>In Popular Culture</h4>
        <p>Penguins are widely considered to be fairly endearing for their upright, waddling gait, swimmiing ability and lack of fear of humans with their blank-and-white plumage to be likened to a suit and tie. 
        </p>
        <p>Penguins have been the subject of many books, films and TV shows over the years such as Happy Feet, Surf's Up and Madagascar. 
        There has also been a feature length documentary called <strong>March of the Penguins</strong> and several BBC documentaries including BBC Earth.
